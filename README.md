## Mozilla Linux Installer

This script was created to more easily install Firefox Developer Edition from the Mozilla website, but was expanded to encompass any Firefox version and Thunderbird.

By default, the instructions below will cause the programs to be installed for your user, but also supports installing as root.

### How to install:

1. Put the extracted "firefox" or "thunderbird" folder that you downloaded from the official websites in the same directory as the script;
2. Under GNOME, right click the installer script, select "proprieties", "permissions", and allow it to be run as application;
3. Right click the script directory, select "Open in terminal" and run it using the command: `./install-firefox-dev` or `./install-mozilla`
